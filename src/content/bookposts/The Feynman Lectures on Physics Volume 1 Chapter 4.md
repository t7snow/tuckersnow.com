# Chapter 4: Conservation of Energy

<aside>What is Energy</aside>

+ Energy types:
	+ kinetic
	+ gravitational
	+ heat
	+ nuclear
	+ mass
	+ radiant
	+ checmical
	+ elastic
	+ 

<aside>Graviational Potential Energy</aside>

+ sum of weights * height  = gravitational potential
+ ernegy relative to something else = potential

+ Right side is fixed,
	+ left side goes up 4 inches and weight does down 4 inches
	+ middle weight goes up 2 inches
	+ 100 goes up one inch
	+ -4(W) + (2)(60)+(1)(100) = 0
		+ W = 55lb

<aside>Kinetic  Energy</aside>

+ *KE* = Weight * Height it could go
+ *KE* = Weight * Velocity^2 / 2g

<aside>Other forms of Energy</aside>

+ *things do not depend on the absolute time*
+ Three simple
	+ COnservation of Charge
		+ the number of positive and negative charges you have never changes?
	+ Conservation of baryons
		+ neutron and protons = baryons
		+ baryons count the exact same
	+ conservation of leptons
		+ electron mu meson and neutrino
		+ antielectron which is a positron -1 lepton
			+ tf
+ *thermodynamics* = laws which govern how much enerfy is avaiable
	+ entropy

# Summary

<summary>Write a concise summary here</summary>
The Cornell Note-taking System is effective because it encourages active engagement during the note-taking process and provides a structured way to review and study the material later. It is widely used by students, professionals, and anyone looking to improve their note-taking and learning efficiency.
