Keenly similar to what is going on now with AI with China and US. Government subsidizing innovation. 

USA initially helped Japan's economy after WW2 with the Marshall plan and literally directly investing into it. Basically any Capitalist entity we were funneling money into. Japan grew too fast and was beating us at our own game. Japan takes victory lap saying we will cook these guys. Didn't write anything else about this book. Just an interesting story left here.
