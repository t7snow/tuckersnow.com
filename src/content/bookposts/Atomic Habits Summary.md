# Atomic Habits - James Clear

Atomic Habits by James Clear is a guide to break bad habits and create better ones. 

## Chapter 1: 

Systems over goals make habits stick. Use goals to set a direction where your systems will work you towards. Focus less on goals as they represent temporary goals. 
#### Notable Quotes

"You should be far more concerned with your current trajectory than with your current results"

"Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits."

"Goals are about the results you want to achieve. Systems are about the processes that lead to them."

"I go and look at a stonecutter hammering away at his rock, perhaps a hundred times without as much as a crack showing in it. Yet at the hundred and first blow it will split in two, and I know it was not the last blow that did it - but all that had gone before"

## Chapter 2: 

Create Identity based habits. Instead of saying, "I want to be more extroverted" say "Yeah, I am an extrovert"

Shift the focus of goals and habits from what you want to achieve (I wish to make 100k next year, I want to learn spanish) to who you want to become (I am someone who completes everything to make X amount, I am someone who learns languages)

#### Notable Quotes

"Many people walk through life in a cognitive slumber, blindly following the norms attached to their identity - 'Im bad with names'"

"There are three layers of behavior change: a change in your outcomes, a change in your processes, or a change in your identity"

“With outcome-based habits, the focus is on what you want to achieve. With identity based habits the focus is on who you wish to become.”

"Your identity emerges out of your habits. Every action is a vote for the type of person you wish to become."

"Who is the type of person that could get X outcome"
## Chapter 3: 

Habits do not make life dull. Many people imagine discipline as something holding them back from living a fulfilling life. May imagine that discipline in studying or fitness stops you from enjoying life, this is not the case. Habits make up life. Going out with friends can be a productive habit. The key is to create habits that increase your lives fulfillment. 

***Every craving is linked to a desire to change your current state. If you reach for your phone - note your current state of mine. More than likely you are stressed, anxious, sad, etc. ***

#### Notable Quotes

"The process of building a habit can be divided into four simple steps: cue, craving, response, and reward"

"The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible."

## Chapter 4:

Consider if the habit you are debating casts a vote for your desired identity? 

## Chapter 5:

Think about how you can combine new habits with old habits. If you already go to the gym, consider how you can listen to books there, run after, etc. 

#### Notable Quotes

“One of the best ways to build a new habit is to identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top. This is called habit stacking."

“The two most common cues are time and location.”

“The habit stacking formula is: After CURRENT HABIT, I will NEW HABIT.”

## Chapter 6:

Make your habits easy by altering your environment. Make the cues of your habit obvious. Give each habit a home. Use phone for one thing. Use your desk for another. Emotions can be cues as well. Take note of the emotional state or thoughts that precede your actions. 
#### Notable Quotes

“Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.”

“It is easier to build new habits in a new environment because you are not fighting against old cues.”

## Chapter 7:

People who have the best "self-control" or "discipline" often times practice it the least. The key is don't put yourself in situations that require it or put yourself in situations where it is easy. It's pretty easy to not be a smoker if you don't start smoking. It's hard to not workout in the gym. 
Reduce exposure to the cue that precedes your habit. 

#### Notable Quotes

“Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.”

## Chapter 8:

Capitalistic science is creating stronger and stronger instant rewards. You can't every truly compete with these, but create your habits as attractive as possible. 
#### Notable Quotes

“The more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming.”

“It is the anticipation of a reward—not the fulfillment of it—that gets us to take action. The greater the anticipation, the greater the dopamine spike.”

## Chapter 11:

One of the worries I had prior to picking up this book: you can fool yourself into feeling like you are making progress. Self-help books do not create any change in your life but give you the feeling of it. Learning endless information is useless without applying it in your daily life. 

#### Notable Quotes

“Focus on taking action, not being in motion.”

“The amount of time you have been performing a habit is not as important as the number of times you have performed it.”

## Chapter 13:

When you start a new habit, focus on checking and clocking in. You do not need to complete things at the beginning. 

## Chapter 14:

Use money and time to your advantage. Spend money on your gym membership. Buy a kindle. Buy a duolingo membership. Enroll in a savings plan. Disable autoplay, disable websites, delete instagram. 

## Chapter 16:

Track your habits with habit tracking apps. 

#### Notable Quotes

“Never miss twice. If you miss one day, try to get back on track as quickly as possible.”
