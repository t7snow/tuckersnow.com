## Review

Piranesi is a novel that does a great job of connecting you with a character. Piranesi is one of the most lovable protagonists in any recent fiction book IMO. (I don't read much recent fiction). He represents the pureness of Humans and what we were made for: Innocence and wonder. Anyone can easily relate to him. He views his world with a sense of spirituality that can rub off on you easily, but still questions and approaches the world with a scientific rigor. The descriptions of this book of the world by Piranesi were really the highlight. The house is a character of its own and feels like a dream world.

The fault of this book lies with the latter half. I feel as though my love of this book came from the mystical quality and the slight allegorical undertones. This falls flat when the introduction of the outside characters, most notably the police officer come in. The arrival of these elements shatters the dreamlike atmosphere that the first half slowly builds. The mystery, which was previously a captivating and internal struggle within Piranesi's mind, transforms into a more conventional plot-driven narrative. It ruined the unique charm of the novel quickly. The allegorical depth that hinted at deeper  questions about humanity and existence is overshadowed by a more literal unfolding of events, completely pulled me out of that mindstate.
