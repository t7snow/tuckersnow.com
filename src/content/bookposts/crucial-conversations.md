Like all self help books, would have been better in bullet points. 

What is a Crucial Conversation?
1. Stakes are high
2. Opinions vary
3. Emotions strong

Hard to know when you're in one of these but need to stay calm at all times.

Dialogue is meant to fill the pool with understanding to come to a better decision

Learn to clarify what it is you do and don't want

Question your behavior. Take breaks in between speaking. Consider your words carefully

Make sure all parties believe you care about everyones ability to come out cleanly

CRIB:
1. Commit to seek mutual purpose: Agree to agree
2. Recognize the purpose behind the strategy: Don’t equate what you’re
asking for with what you want
3. Invent a mutual purpose: A higher level/more encompassing goal
4. Brainstorm new strategies

No Victim, Villain, Helpless

If youre helpless you can still ease the blow

Four types of decision-making: - copied from chaosmanagement notes great resouce
1. Command: Explain why; explain which elements are flexible; don’t overuse
2. Consult: Don’t consult if you’ve made up your mind; announce what you
are doing; report back your decision
3. Vote: Creates winners and losers; don’t cop-out by voting
4. Consensus: Don’t apply to everything, don’t pretend everyone will get first
choice, don’t take turns, commit to support the decision and outcomes no
matter what, have a fall-back if time is an issue

Show zero tolerance for insubordination: Speak up immediately and respectfully

Emotions: Your ability to pull yourself out of the content of a discussion and
focus on the process is inversely proportional to your level of emotion.
