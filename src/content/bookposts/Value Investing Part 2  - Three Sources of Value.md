# Chapter 3 - Valuation in Principle/Practice

<aside>Present value of current and future cash flows</aside>

+ example: project a cost of capital of 10% and a growth rate of 5% then the multiple is 1/[10% * 15%] = 20
+ *EBIT* - net income, operating income
+ *EBITDFA* - operating income + depreciation and amortization

<aside>A Three-Element Approach to valuation: Assets, Earning Power, and Profitable Growth</aside>

1. Element 1: Value of assets
	1. go to balance sheet and examine value of companys assets at end of most reset operating period
	2. adjust stated numbers as you go down - could be off? 
	3. subtract liabilities from assets
	4. ignore intangibles
	5. reproduction cost - cost to reproduce item in current market
	6. *WHAT THIS MEAN* If market value of first in falls below 1 billion reproduction asset cost? 
2. Element 2: Earnings Power Value
	1. less reliable than assets 
	2. *EPV* = Adjusted Earnings * 1/R*, R is the current cost of capital
	3. *adjusted earnings*
		1. fixing one time charges
	4. If EPV falls below reproductive costs then management fucked up 
	5. EPV that EQUALS Asset Value determines intrinsic value
	6. IF EPV Cost SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER Than REPRODUCTIVE COSTS
		1. high barrier to entry
		2. *franchise* = the difference
	7. ***Intrinsic value of a firm is EITHER***
		1. reproduction costs of assets = EPV
		2. assets plus competitive advantige (franchise) 
3. Element 3: Growth
	1. "Growth on a level playing field creates no value"
	2. growth only adds value when firm has a competitive advantage
		1. growth on level = 1mil invest = 1mil value
		2. growth at disadvantage = more costs to less profit
	3. least willing to pay full price - hardest to get 

<aside>INtegrating the elemts within framework</aside>

+ comparison between asset value and EPV most valuable
+ Example: reproduction costs greated than its EPV
	+ failing to earn as much as assets should- management dumb
	+ industry is operating with more than normal excess capacity
		+ expanded too quick or didnt shrink in time
+ If EPV is significantly higher: *management* is cooking, discount the actual value since maangement only gets worse or leaves
	+ also most likely due to competive advantages thanks to barriers to entry: not management 
+ If firm has goof proscpects of growth then you can pay for *FULL EPV* of firm

<aside>Present Value of Future Cash Flows</aside>

+ Discout factor:  ( 1/ 1 + .08 )<sup>T</sup>
	+ .08 interest paid and 1 in denom is the amnt
+ *time value of money *

# Chapter 4 - Valuing the Assets

<aside>Present value of current and future cash flows</aside>

+ if the industry is in serious decline - *liquidation price* when thinking about assets
+ if the industry is growing - *reproduction cost* will need to make more!
	+ negative
+ intangibles worthless if industry disappears
