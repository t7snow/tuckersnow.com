## Summary 
The American Story is a book by someone I had never heard of, but seems to be an awesome figure: David Rubenstein. He has contributed millions to American historical preservation and research. You don't see many large billionaires doing this. His interviews in this book were fascinating and well conducted. My only gripe is that it was easily apparent that they had a short amount of time in these interviews. Questions were cut short or the interviewee was cut off as they delved into an engrossing side story. I listened to the audiobook, which holds the audio recordings of each interview. Each author was an amazing speaker and endlessly charismatic. Inspiring to hear each.

1. John Adams by David McCullough.
One of the most interesting things about this book was the interest I had in reading these figures' private letters after. John Adams was a skilled diplomat. He served as the first ambassador to Britain.

2. Jon Meacham on Thomas Jefferson.
This was a fascinating look at the paradox of Jefferson. Meacham gets right into how the man who wrote "all men are created equal" was a lifelong slave owner. He presents Jefferson as a deeply complex figure who gave the country an ideal to strive for, even if he couldn't live up to it himself. It was also incredible to hear about his insane level of intellect and his personal library, which became the foundation for the Library of Congress.

3. Alexander Hamilton by Ron Chernow.
Was interesting to hear them speak about the Hamilton play before it was really popular. They had no idea what was coming.

4. Benjamin Franklin by Walter Isaacson.
One of my favorites. Isaacson paints a beautiful picture of the charismatic and self-made genius that Franklin was. He was amazing at bringing people together. His diplomatic days were interesting, and the amount of time that was spent OCONUS was also interesting.

5. Founding Mothers by Cokie Roberts.
I loved this one. The personal letters between each founding father and their ladies were fascinating. The part that women played in almost being the ones to bring faltering political parties together and actually achieve things was something I didn't know. The art of the house party seems to be lost today.

6. Abraham Lincoln by Doris Kearns Goodwin.
Lincoln's ability to not punish the South and instead help them rebuild was instrumental in the United States actually becoming united again. Any harsher punishment surely would have continued the splinter.

7. Charles Lindbergh by A. Scott Berg.
I have never in my life heard of this guy, but holy shit, that was interesting. I can see why some say this is the most interesting story, ever. The pure number of people that were described that went out to see him is insane. I believe the author said one-third or two-thirds of the WORLD had seen him at least once. Especially interesting was his beef with the president and him fighting anyways.

8. FDR by Jay Winik.
This interview really captured the force of nature that was FDR. Winik talks about how Roosevelt used his "fireside chats" to give the entire country a sense of hope during the absolute misery of the Great Depression and WWII. You really get a sense of his confidence and his willingness to just throw things at the wall and see what would stick to fix the country's problems. It's a great look at how a leader's personality can shape an era.

10. MLK by Taylor Branch.
Was almost a war general of peace. Super interesting to read about the different decisions he had to make. Especially the description of him allowing children to march. 

12. Ronald Reagan by H.W. Brands.
 Brands really gets across Reagan's powerful optimism and how it connected with so many Americans. The interview covers his economic policies and his hardline stance against the Soviet Union, but it also delves into his skill as a politician who knew how to tell a story. You can see where trump got it from 

13. Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. on the U.S. Supreme Court.
