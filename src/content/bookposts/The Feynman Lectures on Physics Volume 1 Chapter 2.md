# Chapter 2: Basic Physics



<aside>2-2 Physics before 1920</aside>

+ Protons electrically charged and Neutrons Neutral
+ Charges make a field, charges in fields have forces on them and move
+ Magnetics have to do with charges in relative motion
	+ can be attributed to one feld
+ wave anaology: oscilatory interaction when jiggling the comb
+ frequencies are just the oscilations per second? 

<aside>2-3 Quantum Physics</aside>

+ The idea that waves behave more like particles at higher frequencies
+ we dont know whats going on in the nucleus? 
+ generalization: for each particle there is an antiparticle

<aside>2-4 Nuclei and Parricles</aside>

+ atom bomb = nucleus | TNT= movement of electrons
+ what is a "resonance"?
	+ particles that live and die basically instantly
+ things can be their own antiparticle? 
+ the fuck is a  "lepton"?
	+ something that has an electron and a muon? muon is just a heavier electron? 
+ no mass means its never at rest. Photon has 0 mass

# Summary

<summary>Write a concise summary here</summary>

This was a chapter about nothing basic in my opinion. Not sure if he did that on purpose. First, Feynman discusses physics before 1920. He talks about our understanding of before. He discusses how we viewed atoms, the electric field, etc. Starts off by discussing water then moves seamlessly into electgromagnets and makes mention of the analogy to the weave affecting it. Very helpful.
