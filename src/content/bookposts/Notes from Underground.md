# Notes from Underground - Dostoevsky
##### Read 2025.01

This work explores one of my favorite concepts: consciousness as a misstep in evolution. Another work I highly recommend before reading this summary is Blindsight—a sci-fi masterpiece.

In this short novel, Dostoevsky explores the psychology of consciousness. His vessel is the underground man, an egotistical and self-critical contradiction who believes himself to exist outside of society. This book is not meant to be read and agreed with at any point, but is meant to evoke something you may have noticed before but hasn't quite been said to you.

*"All spontaneous people, men of action, are active because they are stupid and limited."*

His heightened level of consciousness causes what he calls "inertia": the state of pondering but not doing.

*"At least, if civilization has not made man more bloodthirsty, it has certainly made him viler in his thirst for blood than he was before. Before, he saw justice in bloodshed and massacred, if he had to, with quiet conscience; now, although we consider bloodshed an abomination, we engage in it more than ever. Which is worse?"*

*"Man, after all, is stupid, phenomenally stupid. That is to say, although he is not in the least stupid, he is so ungrateful that it is useless to expect anything else from him."*

*"And all this for the most frivolous of reasons, hardly worth mentioning, one would think: namely that a man, whoever he is, always and everywhere likes to act as he chooses, and not at all according to the dictates of reason and self-interest;"*

Where did all the sages get the idea that a man's desires must be normal and virtuous?

*"And why are you so firmly, so triumphantly, convinced that only the normal and the positive—in other words, only what is conducive to welfare—is for the advantage of man? Is not reason in error as regards advantage? Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact."*

This is my favorite idea introduced by the underground man, and one of the few I agree with. Man is an ungrateful creature before anything else. We no longer have to fight for food in the dead of night, but our consciousness and CNS have convinced us that we must release that adrenaline during your virtual PowerPoint presentation. Technological advancements have led us to a care-free life, so we now seek out triathlons, rock climbing, and lifting heavy weights as a way to simulate stress and pain.

*"One night as I was passing a tavern I saw through a lighted window some gentlemen fighting with billiard cues, and saw one of them thrown out of the window. At other times I should have felt very much disgusted, but I was in such a mood at the time, that I actually envied the gentleman thrown out of the window—and I envied him so much that I even went into the tavern and into the billiard-room. 'Perhaps,' I thought, 'I'll have a fight, too, and they'll throw me out of the window.'"*
