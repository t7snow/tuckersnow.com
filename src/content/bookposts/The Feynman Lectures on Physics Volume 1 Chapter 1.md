# Chapter 1: Atoms In Motion

<aside>Introduction</aside>

+ Principle of science: The test of all knowlsede is experiment

<aside>1-2/3 Matter is made of atoms</aside>

+ *angstrom* - 10^8
+ Heating water means the atoms jiggle at a faster rate until they go flying and completely seperate
+ Pressure is proportional to density
+ Compressing a gas makes it hotter, slowly, vice versa
+ Ice is hexagonal - explains snowflakes
+ Ice is an open structure - room between the atoms and hexagon
+ Salt dissolves because of the electrical charge causing it to jiggle loose

<aside>1-4 Chemical Reactions</aside>

+ Brownian motion - moving due to the colloids?

# Summary

<summary>Write a concise summary here</summary>
The Cornell Note-taking System is effective because it encourages active engagement during the note-taking process and provides a structured way to review and study the material later. It is widely used by students, professionals, and anyone looking to improve their note-taking and learning efficiency.
