# Chapter 1: Atoms In Motion

<aside>Introduction</aside>

+ Principle of science: The test of all knowledge is experiment.

<aside>1-2/3 Matter is made of atoms</aside>

+ *angstrom* - 10^8
+ Heating water means the atoms jiggle at a faster rate until they go flying and completely separate.
+ Pressure is proportional to density.
+ Compressing a gas makes it hotter, slowly, vice versa.
+ Ice is hexagonal - explains snowflakes.
+ Ice is an open structure - room between the atoms and hexagon.
+ Salt dissolves because of the electrical charge causing it to jiggle loose.

<aside>1-4 Chemical Reactions</aside>

+ Brownian motion - moving due to the colloids?

# Chapter 2: Basic Physics

<aside>2-2 Physics before 1920</aside>

+ Protons are electrically charged and neutrons are neutral.
+ Charges make a field, charges in fields have forces on them and move.
+ Magnetism has to do with charges in relative motion.
    + This can be attributed to one field.
+ Wave analogy: oscillatory interaction when jiggling the comb.
+ Frequencies are just the oscillations per second?

<aside>2-3 Quantum Physics</aside>

+ The idea that waves behave more like particles at higher frequencies.
+ We don't know what's going on in the nucleus?
+ Generalization: for each particle, there is an antiparticle.

<aside>2-4 Nuclei and Particles</aside>

+ Atom bomb = nucleus | TNT = movement of electrons.
+ What is a "resonance"?
    + Particles that live and die basically instantly.
+ Things can be their own antiparticle?
+ What is a "lepton"?
    + Something that has an electron and a muon? Muon is just a heavier electron?
+ No mass means it's never at rest. Photon has 0 mass.

# Chapter 3: The Relation of Physics to Other Sciences

<aside>3-3 Biology</aside>

+ To get a chemical reaction to take place, it's very difficult and requires a lot of energy.
    + The chemical? Has to be pushed inside of the cell? Clearing a way for it?
    + This is skipped with enzymes - made of proteins. This allows the reaction to take place without the extra energy.
+ Biologists are able to track which atom is which by using the isotopes? The number of neutrons?
    + This is allowed to be different?

<aside>3-4 Astronomy</aside>

+ Ears are much better at discerning what makes up something.
    + Can hear different tones in one sound, but eyes can't make out the colors in brown.

<aside>What is Energy</aside>

+ Energy types:
    + Kinetic
    + Gravitational
    + Heat
    + Nuclear
    + Mass
    + Radiant
    + Chemical
    + Elastic

<aside>Gravitational Potential Energy</aside>

+ Sum of weights * height = gravitational potential.
+ Energy relative to something else = potential.
+ ![[Screenshot 2025-02-01 at 12.06.45 PM.png]]
+ Right side is fixed,
    + Left side goes up 4 inches and weight goes down 4 inches.
    + Middle weight goes up 2 inches.
    + 100 goes up one inch.
    + -4(W) + (2)(60) + (1)(100) = 0
        + W = 55lb

<aside>Kinetic Energy</aside>

+ *KE* = Weight * Height it could go.
+ *KE* = Weight * Velocity^2 / 2g

<aside>Other forms of Energy</aside>

+ *Things do not depend on the absolute time.*
+ Three simple principles:
    + Conservation of Charge:
        + The number of positive and negative charges you have never changes.
    + Conservation of Baryons:
        + Neutrons and protons = baryons.
        + Baryons count the exact same.
    + Conservation of Leptons:
        + Electron, mu meson, and neutrino.
        + Antielectron, which is a positron, -1 lepton.
            + tf

+ *Thermodynamics* = Laws which govern how much energy is available.
    + Entropy
