# Summary

## Chapter 1: Introduction

Trade, lending, and merchants were frowned upon by the Church. Wealth accumulation was directly tied to the loss of others at this point. This would follow most people's intuition, and I assume this is how most people still view wealth. Jews allowed themselves to lend to others outside of their own and took up much of the lending and merchant practices that were needed for Christian countries to function. This only added to the hate they received. 

## Chapter 2: Voltaire

Voltaire's main love of the market was how much it diverted people's attention from fighting over religion. The ability to enjoy life (not just in heaven) allowed people to focus more on the present than by constantly fretting over whether they would get into heaven. It also allowed people to come together across country lines. He was amazed with the London stock exchange. Voltaire was also a very sleazy guy. He had a scheme in France where he collaborated with a mathematician to exploit a loophole. He also blamed the Jews for doing all the things he did. 

## Chapter 3: Adam Smith

Adam Smith was a lot more modern in his thoughts than I expected going into this book. He recognized that his ideas on specialization, at the beginning, would not lead to a happier life among the population. He recognized that government intervention is mandatory in many aspects of his ideas. Either way, he recognized that everyone's standard of living is raised through a free market economy. The main idea is that self-interest could be "guided" (although not guided at all) to the common good. 

## Chapter 4: Justus Moser

Honestly, I didn't enjoy this chapter. Moser focused a lot on the effects of specialization on local culture. And honestly, his point still rings true. 

## Chapter 5: Edmund Burke

The father of conservatism. Burke, similar to Moser, was big on tradition and culture of the present and past, not the future. "Burke believed we were growing too dependent on rationalistic thought." If you were to apply rationalism to many traditions, you would do away with them, but they were still vital for the societal fabric. This is happening now in my opinion, and I don't think you can argue it's not happening. You can only argue if you are a fan of it or not. Burke believed in less government intervention by political officials. Political officials—acting either for corporations or the people—make short-sighted decisions that will appease these parties. 

## Chapter 6: Hegel

The most interesting thing to me was Hegel observing that governments need to level out the constant boom and bust cycles. The inequality and isolation he argued is a part of capitalism and the free market. It can also get out of hand quickly. The government needs to intervene to keep social cohesion in these moments. 

## Chapter 7: Marx

Marx is name-dropped more than Adam Smith in public spheres, which is pretty funny. Muller says that most of what Marx wrote was founded on poor ideas that were proven to be incorrect during his writing, but he just kind of ignored it. While he was writing, the largest ever increase in quality of living was occurring around him, which made it hard to argue what he was writing about. Marx agreed with the early Church that profit = exploitation. At the beginning of his writing, much of the industrial revolution was making lives *worse* for people though—increased work weeks, child labor, etc. Marx didn't do much other than commentary that could be slightly tweaked to adapt to changing conditions around him.

## Chapter 8: Matthew Arnold

Arnold was concerned mostly with the effect of capitalism's lust for materialism on high art, culture, and intellectual circles. He wanted people to understand that when you reach after money and wealth, that itself is not an end. It's what you do with it. Government intervention in education. 

## Chapter 9: Weber, Simmel, Sombart

Weber:
Weber believed capitalism was not just an economic system but also a cultural system based on rationalization and "disenchantment." Weber saw it as a source of alienation and deeply "impersonal."

Simmel:
Simmel believed that money itself allows for a more tolerant people and society. You need to depend on other people with money and need to work with other people. It pays to be nice and respectful when you depend on others. Similar to Voltaire, he noted how it was needed for people of differing races, religions, etc. to be able to work together. It allowed them to disregard differences.

Sombart:

Anti-Semite. 

## Chapter 10: Lukacs, Freyer

Lukacs thought the result of capitalism separating producers from consumers created alienation. This led to a feeling of not fulfilling one's potential. He believed communism was the solution to this. Like most Marxists, the way of going about the implementation of communism was left out. Although, I find this to be a weak point to bring up. Many economists didn't outline exactly how capitalism was to be implemented (specifically because it allows people to do its thing). But I suppose that is why you need not specify implementations, and you should if you are arguing for communism.

I didn't know people were fans of Nazism but also not completely horrible people. He wanted people to find meaning in places away from money. Was a Nazi, then wasn't after the war. Sus. 

## Chapter 11: Schumpeter
