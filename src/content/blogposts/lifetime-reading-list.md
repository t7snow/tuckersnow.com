# My Lifetime Reading List

This is gonna be a big post, sorry. This is my lifetime reading list. Often times, when I finish a book I found myself stuck on what to pick next. It is much easier for me to follow a plan, specifically my own. I also am not too worried about sticking to this. I don't view reading as anything as entertainment of value. It is simply something I do rather than scroll brainrotting instagram reels. To stick to a structured plan in its entirity kinda kills reading. 

but, to go through life and imagining myself not reading some of the best written texts by humanity is quite sad. I have seen every movie on the IMDB top 100 and I am 21. I probably haven't read the top 15 books off of a random list. Hopefully this helps.

going to set this up to pull from fable/goodreads soon, but here it is now
